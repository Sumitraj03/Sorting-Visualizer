# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a web-based application that provides a graphical and interactive demonstration of how different sorting algorithms work. It's a great educational tool for anyone interested in learning about data structures and algorithms.

## Features

* **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as the array bars change color and position in real time to show the steps of each sorting algorithm.
* **Multiple Algorithms:** The visualizer includes implementations of several common algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort
* **Customizable Array:** You can generate a new array of a specified size with a single click.
* **Ascending and Descending Order:** Choose to visualize the sorting process in either ascending or descending order.
* **Performance Metrics:** The visualizer displays the time complexity of the selected algorithm, helping you understand its efficiency.
* **Sound Effects:** Audio cues provide feedback for key actions, such as generating the array and completing a sort.
